   For instance, converts ((lambda (x) (+ x 1)) (Y)) to (+ Y 1) in the case
   where Y is an arbitrary expression.

   There are a couple of complexities in the implementation here. Firstly, we
   want to ensure that the arguments are executed in the correct order and only
   once.

   In order to achieve this, we find the lambda forms and visit the body, stopping
   if we visit arguments in the wrong order or non-constant terms such as mutable
   variables or other function calls. For simplicities sake, we fail if we hit
   other lambdas or conds as that makes analysing control flow significantly more
   complex.

   Another source of added complexity is the case where where Y could return multiple
   values: namely in the last argument to function calls. Here it is an invalid optimisation
   to just place Y, as that could result in additional values being passed to the function.

   In order to avoid this, Y will get converted to the form ((lambda (<tmp>) <tmp>) Y).
   This is understood by the codegen and so is not as inefficient as it looks. However, we do
   have to take additional steps to avoid trying to fold the above again and again."
